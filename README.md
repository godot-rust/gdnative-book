# The godot-rust book

The godot-rust book is a user guide for the Rust bindings. The book is currently an early work-in-progress, and contributions are very welcome.

An online version of the book is available at [godot-rust.github.io/book/](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/).

The book is built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). To build the book locally, you can run:

```
$ cargo install mdbook
$ mdbook build
```

To run a local server with automatic updates while editing the book, run:

```
$ mdbook serve
```

This repository is for documentation only. Please make pull requests for the library itself in the [main repo](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust).
