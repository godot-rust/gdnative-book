# Getting Started

The getting started tutorial will introduce you to basic godot-rust concepts. At the end of the tutorial, you'll have a working copy of the [dodge-the-creeps example](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/dodge_the_creeps) from the main repo.

This tutorial assumes some experience with Godot's GUI and GDScript. It assumes a basic understanding of Rust itself.

## Work-in-progress

**The Getting Started tutorial is a work-in-progress, and currently it only covers up to the hello-world example!** To learn more about the API after the tutorial, you'll have to dive into the [documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gdnative/0.9), and the [other examples in the main repo]( https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/). If you have any questions using the bindings, ask away in the `#gdnative_dev` channel on the [Godot Engine community Discord server](https://godotengine.org/community)!
