# An Overview of GDNative

GDNative is the interface between the Godot engine and bindings in native languages, such as C, C++ or Rust.

This chapter gives a broad overview of basic GDNative concepts and godot-rust's approach to implement them in Rust. It is not a usage guide for exposing your Rust code to Godot; see chapter [Binding to Rust code](rust-binding.md) for concrete examples.
