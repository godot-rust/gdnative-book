# Getting Started

This chapter guides you through the process of setting up **gdext** and developing your first application with it.


```admonish note
To read this book, we assume intermediate Rust knowledge. If you are new to Rust, reading the [Rust Book][rust-book] first
is highly encouraged. You won't need to know 100% of the language, but you should know basic concepts (type system, generics,
traits, borrow checking, safety).

Some familiarity with Godot is also necessary, although it is possible to learn gdext together with Godot. 
However, we won't reiterate basic Godot concepts -- so if you choose that approach, we recommend to read
[the official Godot tutorial][godot-tutorial] in parallel.
```

In addition to this book, you can use the following resources to learn more about the project:
* The [official API documentation][api-docs].
* A small example game [Dodge the Creeps][dodge-the-creeps].
